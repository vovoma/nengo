class Operator(object):
    """Base class for operator instances understood by Nengo.

    During one simulator timestep, a `.Signal` can experience

    1. at most one set operator (optional)
    2. any number of increments
    3. any number of reads
    4. at most one update

    in this specific order.

    A ``set`` defines the state of the signal at time :math:`t`, the start
    of the simulation timestep. That state can then be modified by
    ``increment`` operations. A signal's state will only be ``read`` after
    all increments are complete. The state is then finalized by an ``update``,
    which denotes the state that the signal should be at time :math:`t + dt`.

    Each operator must keep track of the signals that it manipulates,
    and which of these four types of manipulations is done to each signal
    so that the simulator can order all of the operators properly.

    .. note:: There are intentionally no default values for the
              `~.Operator.reads`, `~.Operator.sets`, `~.Operator.incs`,
              and `~.Operator.updates` properties to ensure that subclasses
              explicitly set these values.

        A label associated with the operator, for debugging purposes.

    Implements ``output[...] = fn(*args)`` where ``args`` can
    include the current simulation time ``t`` and an input signal ``x``.

    Note that ``output`` may also be None, in which case the function is
    called but no output is captured.

    Parameters
    ----------
    output : Signal or None
        The signal to be set. If None, the function is still called.
    fn : callable
        The function to call.
    t : Signal or None
        The signal associated with the time (a float, in seconds).
        If None, the time will not be passed to ``fn``.
    x : Signal or None
        An input signal to pass to ``fn``.
        If None, an input signal will not be passed to ``fn``.
    tag : str, optional (Default: None)
        A label associated with the operator, for debugging purposes.

    Attributes
    ----------
    fn : callable
        The function to call.
    output : Signal or None

        The signal associated with the time (a float, in seconds).
        If None, the time will not be passed to ``fn``.
    tag : str or None
        A label associated with the operator, for debugging purposes.
    x : Signal or None
        An input signal to pass to ``fn``.
        If None, an input signal will not be passed to ``fn``.

    1. sets ``[] if output is None else [output]``
